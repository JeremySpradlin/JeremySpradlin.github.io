# The God of War

For as long as humans have looked up to the heavens and kept track of what they have seen there, the Red Planet has filled the human imagination with stories and myths, some with their origins extending back into history farther than we can see, and many being more recent as the eyes that we use to observe the sky and the other planets in our solar system have grown more and more capable.  

The past few decades have even had humanity landing machines on our distant neighbor, with all sorts of cameras and other sensors, in order to collect information and beam it back to earth, so that we can better get to know the God of War.  One of the most recent machines we've sent to Mars is the rover Curiosity.  

## One Giant Leap for Machine Kind

Curiosity is a car-sized rover designed to explore the Gale crater, launched from Cape Canaveral in November of 2011, landing on Mars almost 9 months later.  

Curiosity contained many different scientific instruments, with a focus on Martian climate and geology.  We will be looking at data from the REMS package regarding the former.  

The Rover Environmental Monitoring Station, or REMS for short, contains instruments designed to provide daily and seasonal reports on the meteorological conditions around the rover.  Over the course of 6 years, data was collected for the max and minimum temperatures, as well as air pressure.  In this article, we will look to see what sort of annual weather patterns we can detect, if any, from analyzing that data.  

## A Martian Year

The first thing to understand when looking at annual weather patterns from our rover on the surface of Mars, is the Martian year.  Here on Earth, our years are a little over 365 days long, divided into twelve months.  Mars also has 12 months, but each month is a little longer, as a Martian year is approximately 687 Terran days (24 hours).  The 12 months are taken by using a measurement, The Solar Longitude, or Mars-Sun angle, which is the angle of the sun to the planet as measured from the northern hemisphere.  This measurement is often measured as Ls.
