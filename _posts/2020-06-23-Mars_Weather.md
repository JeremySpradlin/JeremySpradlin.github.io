# Our Favorite Science Fiction Star

For as long as humans have looked up to the heavens and kept track of what they have seen there, the Red Planet has filled the human imagination with stories and myths, some with their origins extending back into history farther than we can see, and many being more recent as the eyes that we use to observe the sky and the other planets in our solar system have grown more and more capable.  

The past few decades have even had humanity landing machines on our distant neighbor, with all sorts of cameras and other sensors, in order to collect information and beam it back to earth, so that we can better get to know the God of War.  One of the most recent machines we've sent to Mars is the rover Curiosity.  

### One giant leap for machine kind

Curiosity is a car-sized rover designed to explore the Gale crater, launched from Cape Canaveral in November of 2011, landing on Mars almost 9 months later.  

Curiosity contained many different scientific instruments, with a focus on Martian climate and geology.  We will be looking at data from the REMS package regarding the former.  

The Rover Environmental Monitoring Station, or REMS for short, contains instruments designed to provide daily and seasonal reports on the meteorological conditions around the rover.
